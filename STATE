we're trying to hook our own ssh known hosts callback (knownHostKey) into chezmoi init's builtinGitClone when there is no known hosts file
we have code to read the range of IP addressses and SSH keys from GitHub to verify
right now the code is not being called
it has something to do with gitssh's HostKeyCallback
e.g. https://cs.github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/f462240520c13e33c1e5fb4a23abd67368273d8a/util/git/client.go?q=lang%3Ago+go-git+HostKeyCallback#L264
https://cs.github.com/?scopeName=All+repos&scope=&q=lang%3Ago+go-git+HostKeyCallback
